# SmartHealthyPort

Welcome to the root repository which contains the source code of the microservices that give support to the SmartHealthyPort architecture.

SmartHealthyPort is a coordinated project (refs. CEIJ-C01.1 and CEIJ-C01.2) between the University of Almería (UAL) and the University of Cádiz (UCA), Spain, that proposes an innovative, reusable and adaptable platform to monitor and manage, more efficiently and in real time, air quality in different seaports, as well as automatically send contextual alerts in order to reduce as much as possible the damage to the environment, to the cities in which they are integrated, as well as to their socioeconomic context.
